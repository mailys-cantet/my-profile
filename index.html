			<h1>Hi, I'm Maïlys!</h1>

			<p>
			Hi everyone! I am a travelling and music lover, and I am pursuing a Global Bachelor in Business Administration (GBBA) at ESSEC Business School! Welcome to my page!

			<h2>About me!</h2>
			<p>
				I am going to tell you more about myself! I grew up in a small city in the South of France, Gap, located between the sea and the mountains. This is somehow great because I can go skiing in winter and go to the sea in summer (it is a 2h30 drive from my place)! I speak French and English fluently, and I am currently learning Chinese and Spanish. I have different passions which you can discover if you scroll down my page!

			<h2>💅 My passions and interests! 💅</h2>
			<p>
				I like a lot of things, and particularly sports. I used to ski a lot, swim, horse ride, and run but I stopped when I moved to Cergy for my studies. Apart from that, I like to read, try new food (Asian food 🍜 is my favorite), take pictures, and I am an automobile lover 🏎️! But most of all, I like to travel ✈️! To be honest, I like to say that every problem in life can be solved by traveling, which is probably why my money travels faster than me lol!

			<h2>🎶 Music 🎶</h2>
			<p>
				When I was younger, I played clarinet for over 10 years. I stopped playing when I was in my last year of high school. I also took a liking to listening to music whenever I can. Now, it helps me relax when I'm stressed. I really like to listen to chill songs. Here are two of them! You can listen to them by clicking on the images 🙃
